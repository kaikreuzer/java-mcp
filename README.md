# java-mcp

A Java implementation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) transports specification.

This project aims to provide a Java library for interacting with MCP-compliant clients and servers, implementing the `stdio` and `Streamable HTTP` transport mechanisms as defined in the specification: https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports

More details and implementation will follow.
